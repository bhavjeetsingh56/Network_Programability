# Network_Programability

-> In whole this Network Programability repository, I have implemented the Network Programability using the REST, NETCONF API. I have also used NETMIKO in one of my scripts
to get the running configuration of the CIsco Always on Sandbox devices.

-> I have also used the POSTMAN which is the greatest REST API Client and once I get confirmed which kind of Output we are getting from the device like whether it's JSON or
XML, I started to code in python using the desired module to convert the Specific Output into readable form in pyhton(into dictionaries).

-> Other than this, I don't have Proper knowledge of NX-OS devices because I grade myself CCNP(R&S) in terms of knowledge. But as far as I know, I have used the NX-OS API
to access the device configuration. Under the NX-OS API, we have two options that is JSON-RPC and NX-OS CLI.

-> I have implemented both of them in python code. To go way beyond, Under NX-OS CLI we can also use JSON or XML. Its totally depends on you which one you are more fimilar
with it.

-> NX-API also have the option of NX-REST(Which is totally the REST API) to achieve our desired objective.

-> I have also make a subdirectory for netconf, in which I have implemented the NETCONF to update the interface configuration. I Leverage the NEtconf for getting the details
of the interface on the device.

-> I have different directory for restconf, in which I have implemented the CRUD operations using the REST API.
